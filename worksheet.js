// PART 0: Write a function called squareDance() that squares each number in an array.


// PART 1: write a function called nicer(). 
// It should clean up the language in its input sentence. 
// Forbidden words include heck, dang, crappy, and dang.


// // PART 2: write a function called capitalizeAll(). 
// It should take as input a sentence and capitalize the first letter
// of every word in the sentence. 


// // PART 3: write a function called properSentences(). It should take as input a string and capitalize the first letter of every sentence in that string. (For our purposes, all sentences will end with periods. Write one that works with ? and ! and receive a gratifying high five, right on the hand!)


// // PART 4: write a function called iPutTheFunIn(). It should take a string as input. The output should be a copy of the original string with the word 'fun' inserted into the center of the string. 


// // HARD MODE

// // PART 5: write a function called split(). it should take two inputs: (1) a string and (2) a delimiter

// // obviously, you may not use the native .split() method. your task here is to reverse-engineer .split() and write your own. 


// // PART 6: write a function called pipeline(). it should take three inputs: (1) a starting value, (2) a function, and (3) another function. it should use functions (2) and (3) on the starting value, one after the other, and return a new value that has been processed by both function (2) and function (3).
